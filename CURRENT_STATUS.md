## ⏰ WHEN TO CHECK

**This run completes:** ~10:26 AM - 2:26 PM (4-8 hours from start)

**Check results:**
```bash
python3 scripts/formula_cli.py results --latest
cat analysis_outputs/auto_analysis/novel_patterns.txt
```

**Will tell you:**
- Do novel constants replicate?
- Real correlations with proper samples?
- Is this worth pursuing?
