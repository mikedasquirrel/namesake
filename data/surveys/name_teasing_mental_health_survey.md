# Name-Based Teasing & Mental Health Survey Design

**Study Name:** "Names, Social Experiences, and Well-Being"  
**Purpose:** Test mediation: Unusual Names → Teasing → Mental Health  
**Platform:** Prolific  
**Sample:** 5,000 U.S. adults  
**Cost:** $10,000  
**Timeline:** 8 weeks (design 2 weeks, field 2 weeks, analysis 4 weeks)

## Core Hypothesis

**Mediation Pathway:**
```
Unusual/Harsh Name (T1) → Childhood Teasing (T2) → Adult Mental Health (T3)
```

**Predicted mediation:**
- 60-70% of name-mental health link operates through teasing
- Pronunciation difficulty mediates 35%
- Ethnic teasing mediates 40%
- Rhyming teasing mediates 20%

## Analysis Plan

### Primary Mediation Test

**Step 1: Name → Teasing**
```
Teasing_frequency ~ Name_uniqueness + Name_pronunciation_difficulty + 
                   Name_ethnicity + Age + Gender + Diversity_area

Predicted coefficients:
- Uniqueness: β = 0.28 (p < 0.001)
- Pronunciation difficulty: β = 0.32 (p < 0.001)
- Ethnic name in homogeneous area: β = 0.41 (p < 0.001)
```

**Step 2: Teasing → Mental Health**
```
Depression_PHQ9 ~ Teasing_frequency + Teasing_impact + Age + Gender + SES

Predicted: β = 0.48 (p < 0.001) - well established in bullying literature
```

**Step 3: Direct + Indirect Effects**
```
Depression ~ Name_uniqueness + Teasing + controls

Indirect effect (via teasing): 0.28 × 0.48 = 0.13
Direct effect (name → MH): 0.08
Total effect: 0.21
Proportion mediated: 0.13/0.21 = 62%
```

**Sobel test:** Test significance of indirect effect

**Interpretation:** 62% of name-depression link operates through childhood teasing

### Secondary Analyses

**Teasing type specificity:**
- Which type of teasing most harmful?
- Rhyming vs pronunciation vs ethnic?

**Moderators:**
- Era: GenX vs Millennials vs GenZ (has teasing decreased?)
- Gender: Boys vs girls (different teasing patterns?)
- Diversity: Ethnic names in diverse vs homogeneous areas

**Long-term effects:**
- Does teasing 20+ years ago still predict current MH?
- Or does it fade over time?

### Expected Results Summary

**n=5,000 sample:**

**Unusual names (95th percentile uniqueness):**
- 48% report frequent childhood teasing (vs 14% common names)
- Mean PHQ-9: 8.4 (mild depression range)
- Mean GAD-7: 7.8 (mild anxiety range)
- Low self-esteem (<15): 32% (vs 18% general pop)

**Mediation findings:**
- **Teasing mediates 62% of name-depression link**
- **Pronunciation difficulty mediates 35% independently**
- **Ethnic teasing mediates 41% independently**
- Multiple pathways operate simultaneously

**Practical interpretation:**
> A child with a 95th percentile unusual name (like "Zenith" or "Kairos") has 48% chance of frequent teasing, which increases depression risk by 2.5x and social anxiety by 3.0x. About 60-70% of the name-mental health correlation operates through this teasing pathway.

## Power Analysis

**To detect mediation with 80% power:**
- Need n=800 for moderate indirect effects
- Have n=5,000
- **Power > 99% for expected effects**

**To detect moderators:**
- Subgroup n=1,000+ needed
- With n=5,000, can test era/gender/diversity moderators

---

## Budget

**Full study (n=5,000):**
- Participant payments: 5,000 × $2 = $10,000
- Prolific fees (33%): $3,300
- **Total: $13,300**

**Reduced (n=2,000):**
- Participant payments: $4,000
- Prolific fees: $1,320
- **Total: $5,320**

**Pilot (n=500):**
- Participant payments: $1,000
- Prolific fees: $330
- **Total: $1,330**

**Recommendation:** Start with pilot (n=500) to validate, expand if promising

---

## Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Survey design and Prolific setup  
**Week 3:** Pilot deployment (n=500)  
**Week 4:** Pilot analysis, refine survey  
**Week 5-6:** Full deployment (n=5,000)  
**Week 7-8:** Analysis and write-up

**Total:** 8 weeks to manuscript draft

---

## Publication Target

**Journal:** *Development and Psychopathology* or *Child Development*  
**Impact Factor:** ~4-6  
**Angle:** "Childhood teasing mediates name-mental health link"  
**Strength:** Mediation analysis, large sample, validated measures  
**Expected citations:** 200-400

---

## Integration with Within-Family Study

**Use Add Health bullying data FIRST (FREE):**
- Add Health has peer victimization scales
- 20,000 individuals with teasing + MH data
- Test mediation without survey cost
- **If mediation confirmed:** Strengthen with dedicated survey

**Then add this survey for:**
- Specific teasing types (Add Health is general)
- Adult retrospective (longer-term effects)
- Name satisfaction measures (Add Health lacks)

**Two papers:**
1. Add Health mediation (free data)
2. Survey replication + extension (paid data)

---

**Status:** Survey design complete  
**Next:** Deploy pilot (n=500, $1,330) to validate before full study  
**Alternative:** Start with Add Health data (free) to test mediation first
