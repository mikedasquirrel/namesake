research_questions:
  - "Do name characteristics predict BoardGameGeek ratings?"
  - "Are there distinct naming clusters by game category?"
  - "How have naming conventions evolved 1950s-2024?"
  - "Do cultural traditions (US vs Euro vs Japanese) show different patterns?"
  - "Does name complexity correlate with game complexity?"

notes: |
  Novel analysis examining board game naming patterns across:
  - 75 years of gaming history (1950-2024)
  - Multiple cultural traditions (American mass-market, European designer, Japanese imports)
  - Gaming revolution eras (pre-Catan, Eurogame explosion, contemporary crowdfunding)
  - Name complexity vs game complexity correlation
  - The "colon problem" (base game vs expansions)
  
  Expected discoveries:
  - Euro abstraction (Agricola, Azul) vs American thematics (Pandemic, Betrayal)
  - Temporal expansion (+1.2 syllables per decade hypothesis)
  - Complexity correlation (heavier games = longer names)
  - Memorability paradox in gaming context
