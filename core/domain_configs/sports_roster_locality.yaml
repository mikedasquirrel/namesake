# Cross-domain analysis examining how professional sports rosters reflect
# American name demographics and phonetic characteristics

domain: sports_roster_locality
display_name: "Sports Roster Locality & Demographic Composition Analysis"

research_questions:
  - "Do professional sports rosters reflect American demographic name distributions, or do they deviate significantly?"
  - "How does roster 'americanness' (phonetic patterns) vary by sport and team?"
  - "What is the melodiousness of each roster relative to its sport's characteristics (contact level, pace, precision)?"
  - "How do teams compare to their league averages and to each other in terms of name composition?"
  - "Do different sports attract different demographic name patterns?"

notes: |
  Novel cross-domain analysis combining:
  - Roster amalgamation methodology (from MLB teams)
  - Demographic baseline comparisons (Census data)
  - Sport-specific melodiousness adjustments
  - Multi-level statistical comparisons
  
  Expected findings:
  - Significant deviations from American baseline demographics
  - Sport-specific patterns (NBA most international, NFL most American)
  - Geographic team variations (coastal vs heartland)
  - Melodiousness correlation with sport precision/contact characteristics
