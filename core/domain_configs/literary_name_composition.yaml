# Literary Name Composition Analysis
# Cross-domain analysis examining how fictional naming patterns differ between
# modern fiction, nonfiction, and synoptic gospels, and whether name characteristics
# predict character roles, behaviors, and narrative outcomes

domain: literary_name_composition
display_name: "Literary Name Composition & Predictive Nominative Analysis"

research_questions:
  - "Do fictional character names differ systematically from nonfiction person names in melodiousness, commonality, and phonetic structure?"
  - "Can character roles (protagonist, antagonist, supporting) be predicted from name characteristics alone?"
  - "Do synoptic gospels follow distinct naming patterns compared to modern fiction and nonfiction?"
  - "What proportion of names in each category are invented vs. historically/culturally real?"
  - "Do character outcomes (survival, success, transformation) correlate with specific name phonetic patterns?"
  - "How do place names and invented terminology differ across literary categories?"

notes: |
  Novel cross-domain analysis combining:
  - Literary character role classification
  - NLP entity extraction for name identification
  - Predictive nominative determinism testing
  - Cross-category comparisons (fiction/nonfiction/gospels)
  - Invented vs real name phonetic patterns
  
  Key innovations:
  - First systematic test of whether character roles can be predicted from names
  - Comparison of gospels to modern literature (historical benchmark)
  - Quantification of invented name proportion by category
  - Character outcome prediction from name phonetics
  
  Expected findings:
  - Fiction: Higher melodiousness, more invented names
  - Protagonists: More melodious, common names than antagonists
  - Gospels: Middle ground between fiction and nonfiction
  - Predictive accuracy: 60-70% for role classification
  - Survival: Positively correlated with melodiousness
