research_questions:
  - "Do name phonetics predict baseball positions (P/C/IF/OF)?"
  - "Do pitchers have distinct naming patterns?"
  - "Do power hitters have harsher names than contact hitters?"
  - "How has internationalization changed name patterns?"
  - "Do closers have shorter names than starters?"

notes: |
  Baseball-specific analyses:
  - Pitcher mystique hypothesis (professional distance)
  - Power name hypothesis (sound symbolism for HR hitters)
  - Closer effect (9th inning pressure demands memorability)
  - Latino inflection point (1990s expansion)
  - Position prediction analogous to NBA (68%) and NFL success
