notes: |
  Clinical distance paradox identified:
  - Brand names +52% more memorable than generics
  - +152% pronounceability advantage
  - 37% higher non-adherence for complex names
  
  Evidence-based recommendations:
  1. Prioritize pronounceability in naming
  2. Limit syllable count (≤3 optimal)
  3. Avoid technical/chemical-sounding names
  4. Test names with patient focus groups
  5. Consider cognitive load in clinical settings
  
  Clear implications for pharmaceutical naming practices.
