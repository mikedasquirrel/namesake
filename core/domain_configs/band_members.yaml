# Band Member Role & Name Analysis Domain Configuration
# Individual band member names and role prediction

domain: band_members
display_name: "Band Member Role & Name Analysis"

research_questions:
  - "Do phonetic features predict which role (bassist/drummer/vocalist/etc.) a member plays?"
  - "Does name 'harshness' correlate with drummer/guitarist roles?"
  - "Do 'smoother' names correlate with vocalist/songwriter roles?"
  - "Does collective member name composition predict band commercial success?"
  - "Are there temporal shifts in name-role patterns?"

  Individual band member analysis (vs band name analysis).
  Role prediction analogous to NFL/NBA position analysis.
  Novel multi-level modeling: members nested within bands.
  Collective composition effects on band success.
