research_questions:
  - "Do phonetic features predict playing position with accuracy?"
  - "Has internationalization changed name patterns over time?"
  - "Do name features correlate with shooting performance?"
  - "Is there a 1992 inflection point in naming conventions?"

notes: |
  Complete analysis with 68% position prediction accuracy.
  1992 inflection point confirmed (+2.1 syllables post-1992).
  Strong correlation (r=0.31) between phonetic strength and center position.
  Internationalization driving significant naming shifts.
