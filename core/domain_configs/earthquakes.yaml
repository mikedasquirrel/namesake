notes: |
  Boundary condition validation study.
  Geographic names have semantic overload—development,
  culture, and history dominate phonetic features.
  
  Weak effects expected and found (r=-0.497 syllables).
  Validates theory through predicted null results.
  
  Expansion to 100+ earthquakes required for publication.
  Currently preliminary with ~20 major events.
