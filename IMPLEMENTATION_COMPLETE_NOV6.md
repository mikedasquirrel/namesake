### III. Theoretical Advances

**1. Nominative Determinism Redefined**

**Old:** Names determine outcomes  
**New:** Measurable correlation between name features and outcomes, mediated by context-specific mechanisms, with effect sizes/directions varying by domain

**Better term:** "Context-Activated Naming Effects"

**2. Context-Activation Principle**

Names matter when and how context activates them.

**Activation conditions:**
- Salience (name must be noticed)
- Relevance (name must relate to outcome)
- Mechanism (pathway must exist)
- Absence of confounds (signal not overwhelmed)

**3. Five Mechanisms Identified**

1. **Behavioral Response:** Hurricanes (threat perception → evacuation)
2. **Market Signaling:** MTG (aesthetic → collectible value)
3. **Cultural Capital:** Diversity (individualism → economics)
4. **Identity Expression:** Bands (pronunciation → ideology signal) [predicted]
5. **Network Effects:** Lineage (success → imitation → propagation) [predicted]

**4. Cross-Domain Patterns**

- **Pattern 1:** No universal formula (context determines what matters)
- **Pattern 2:** Mechanism matters more than effect size
- **Pattern 3:** Confounds are domain-specific
- **Pattern 4:** Non-linear relationships common (inverse-U, cycles)
- **Pattern 5:** Cultural associations dominate pure phonetics

### XI. Risk Mitigation

**High-Confidence Work (Low Risk):**
- Hurricane analysis (strong signal, ready now)
- MTG analysis (real patterns documented)
- Name diversity descriptives (large sample)
- Framework synthesis (based on evidence)

**Medium-Confidence Work (Moderate Risk):**
- Name diversity causality (need better data)
- Band collection (API limits, but manageable)
- Framework paper acceptance (high bar)

**Low-Confidence Work (High Risk, High Reward):**
- CHY-NAH validation (could be null)
- Geopolitical linguistics (speculative)
- Phonetic lineage (causality hard)

**Contingency Plans:**
- If band collection fails → 3-domain framework still publishable
- If CHY-NAH null → colonial legacy backup findings
- If rejections → lower-tier journals, iterate

### XIII. The Paradigm Shift

**From:** "Do names determine outcomes?" (yes/no question)  
**To:** "How do names matter in different contexts?" (discovery question)

**Evidence so far:**
- Hurricanes: YES (behavioral response, ROC 0.916)
- MTG instants: YES (modest, CV R² 0.262)
- MTG legendaries: NO (mechanics dominate)
- Name diversity: UNCLEAR (correlation yes, causality uncertain)
- Bands: TBD (framework ready, awaits data)

**Meta-finding:**
Nominative determinism is real but context-specific. No universal formula exists. Mechanisms matter more than effect sizes. Each domain requires its own analysis.

**This is discovery science at its best.**
