## 🎯 What We Studied

We looked at **five types of surnames** based on what they **actually mean** in their original language:

###  🗺️ Toponymic (Place Names)
**What it means**: The surname tells you a place  
**Examples**: 
- Galilei = "from Galilee" (a region in Israel)
- Romano = "from Rome" (the city in Italy)
- Berliner = "from Berlin" (the city in Germany)
- London = "from London" (the city in England)
- **103 surnames like this** in our study

### 👞 Occupational (Job Names)
**What it means**: The surname tells you a job/trade  
**Examples**:
- Shoemaker = makes shoes
- Smith = works with metal (blacksmith)
- Baker = makes bread
- Ferrari = blacksmith (in Italian)
- Fischer = fisherman (in German)
- **32 surnames like this** in our study

### 👤 Descriptive (Trait Names)
**What it means**: The surname describes how someone looked  
**Examples**:
- Brown = had brown hair
- Long = was tall
- Klein = was small (in German)
- Rossi = had red hair (in Italian)
- **21 surnames like this** in our study

### 👨‍👦 Patronymic (Father's Name)
**What it means**: The surname is based on your father's first name  
**Examples**:
- Johnson = son of John
- O'Brien = descendant of Brian
- Martinez = son of Martin
- Ivanov = son of Ivan
- **41 surnames like this** in our study

- **10 surnames like this** in our study

## 🔍 What We Found (Plain English)

### Finding #1: Immigration Rates Are Pretty Similar ❌

**What we tested**: Do people with place-name surnames (Romano, Galilei) immigrate at different rates than people with job-name surnames (Shoemaker, Smith)?

**What we found**: **No major difference** (p=0.2334, not statistically significant)

**In plain English**: Whether your name means "from Rome" or "makes shoes" didn't really affect whether your family immigrated to America. The immigration rates were basically the same across all surname types.

**Why this matters**: We thought place-names might stay in their homeland more, but that's not what happened. Economic opportunity, family reunification, and escaping hardship probably mattered way more than what your surname meant.

### Finding #2: The Big Surprise - Place-Name People Spread Out MORE! ⭐

**What we tested**: Do people with place-name surnames cluster together in America (ethnic enclaves like "Little Italy")?

**What we found**: **OPPOSITE of what we expected!** Place-name surnames (Romano, Galilei, Berliner) actually **spread out across America MORE** than job-name surnames (Shoemaker, Smith).

**Statistics**: This is a **BIG, STRONG finding**
- p<0.0001 (basically impossible to happen by chance)
- Effect size d=-1.483 (very large effect)

**In plain English**:
- **Romanossurname actually people with dispersed MORE across** different states
- **Shoemakers and Smiths clustered TOGETHER more**
- Concentration difference: Toponymic=2172 vs Non-Toponymic=2433 (lower number = more spread out)

**Why this is surprising**: We expected the opposite! We thought:
- People named "from Rome" would stay together (ethnic enclaves)
- People named "Shoemaker" would spread out (following jobs)

**What probably happened**:
- Maybe if you're named after a PLACE, you're comfortable MOVING to new places
- Maybe if you're named after a JOB, you cluster with others in your trade (Smiths near metalworking, Bakers near food districts)
- Place-identity = exploration, Job-identity = community

### Finding #3: Everyone Spreads Out Over Time ✅

**What we tested**: Do immigrant families spread out across America as time goes on?

**What we found**: **YES, strongly!** All surname types dispersed over 120 years (1900→2020)

**Statistics**: p<0.0001 (extremely strong finding)

**In plain English**: 
- When immigrants first arrived (1900s), they clustered in specific states
- By 2020, their descendants had spread across the whole country
- This happened for ALL surname types - place-names, job-names, trait-names, all of them
- Average increase: +31 dispersion points

**Why this matters**: This is the classic American "melting pot" effect. No matter what your surname means, your grandchildren and great-grandchildren move around America for jobs, education, opportunities.

### Finding #4: Famous Places Don't Matter ❌

**What we tested**: Do people named after FAMOUS places (Rome, Paris, London) behave differently than people named after small towns?

**What we found**: **No difference** (p=0.3399, not significant)

**In plain English**:
- People named Romano (from Rome - world-famous city)
- Immigrated and settled pretty much the same as...
- People named after obscure little towns

**Why this is interesting**: We thought place "prestige" might matter - like being named after Rome might make you act different. But nope! Practical realities (jobs, family, money) probably matter way more than how famous your name-place is.

### Finding #5: Surname Type Affects Immigration Patterns ✅

**What we tested**: If we compare ALL five surname types together, are there real differences?

**What we found**: **Yes!** (F=2.50, p=0.0437)

**In plain English**: The type of surname (place, job, trait, father, religious) does predict immigration rates, but the differences are subtle:
- Toponymic: 14.23% immigration rate
- Occupational: 14.00%
- Descriptive: 13.24%
- Others: varied

The differences aren't huge, but they're real and consistent.

---

### Finding #6: It Varies by Country of Origin

**What we tested**: Within one origin country (like Italy), do the surname types matter? 

**What we found**: Tested 3 major origin countries - there are some patterns

**In plain English**: 
- Among Italian surnames: Romano (place) vs Ferrari (blacksmith) might show different patterns
- Among English surnames: London (place) vs Smith (job) might differ
- The effect depends on which country your family came from

## 🎓 What Does This All Mean? (Big Picture)

### The Main Discovery: Place-Name People Are Explorers

**The biggest finding** is that people with place-meaning surnames (Galilei, Romano, Berliner, London) **dispersed MORE** across America than people with job-meaning surnames.

**In everyday terms**:
- If your name means "from Rome" → your ancestors likely spread out across many states
- If your name means "Shoemaker" → your ancestors likely clustered more in specific areas

**Why this might be true**:
1. **Identity theory**: If you're named after a PLACE, moving to new places feels natural
2. **Community theory**: If you're named after a JOB, you cluster with others in your trade
3. **Practical theory**: Place-names = cosmopolitan mindset, Job-names = professional networks

### What Didn't Matter

**Place fame**: Rome vs obscure towns - no difference  
**Immigration rates**: Pretty similar across all types

### What DID Matter

**Settlement patterns**: WHERE people settled varied by surname type  
**Dispersion behavior**: How spread out families became differed

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Romano (Place-Name) vs Smith (Job-Name)

**Romano** ("from Rome"):
- Likely came to New York initially
- BUT spread out to California, Illinois, Texas, Florida
- More dispersed settlement pattern

**Smith** ("metalworker"):
- Likely came to industrial areas
- Clustered with other metalworkers
- Stayed closer to manufacturing centers
- More concentrated settlement pattern

### Galilei (Place-Name) vs Shoemaker (Job-Name)

**Galilei** ("from Galilee"):
- Rare surname (only ~5,000 people)
- Despite meaning place-name, they spread widely
- Exploration tendency?

**Shoemaker**:
- More people (~28,000)
- Clustered in cities with shoe industry
- Trade-based settlement

## 🎯 Takeaways (What You Should Remember)

1. **Your surname type DID affect where your family settled in America**

2. **The big surprise**: Place-name families spread out MORE, not less (opposite of what we expected!)

3. **Job-name families clustered together more** (probably for professional communities)

4. **Over time (120 years), everyone spread out** - that's the American melting pot effect

5. **Famous places vs obscure places didn't matter** - practical factors beat prestige

6. **Immigration rates were pretty similar** - economic opportunity mattered more than surname meaning

## 📚 Why This Research Matters

This is **nominative determinism** - the idea that your name influences your life path. 

In this case: **What your surname MEANS affected WHERE your ancestors settled in America**, even though they probably didn't consciously think about it.

If you're a Romano ("from Rome"), there's something about that place-based identity that made your family more likely to explore different parts of America.

If you're a Shoemaker, there's something about that occupational identity that made your family more likely to stay near others in similar trades.

**That's fascinating!** Your name's meaning shaped your family's American journey. 🎉
