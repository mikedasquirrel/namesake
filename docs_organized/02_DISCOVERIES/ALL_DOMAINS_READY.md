## 🔬 RESEARCH QUESTIONS NOW TESTABLE

### Universal Questions (Across All Domains)

1. **Is there a universal visual signature of success?**
   - Do successful entities (across ALL 10 domains) share visual properties?
   - Does hue matter universally? Complexity? Symmetry?

2. **Are patterns domain-specific or universal?**
   - Does the same formula work everywhere?
   - Or do different domains need different formulas?

3. **Do mathematical constants emerge across domains?**
   - If golden ratio appears in crypto AND ships AND films → universal
   - If only in crypto → domain-specific

### Domain-Specific Questions

**Crypto:**
- Do "techy" blue names outperform? (Color hypothesis)
- Do simple names (Bitcoin) beat complex names (Avalanche)?
- Does symmetry predict stability?

**MTG Cards:**
- Do fantasy names have visual signatures?
- Does name complexity correlate with card complexity?
- Do legendary cards have different visual patterns?

**NFL:**
- Do "harsh" phonetic names predict defensive success?
- Do "smooth" names predict skill positions?
- Does name power correlate with Pro Bowl selections?

**Hurricanes:**
- THE FAMOUS ONE: Do harsh names cause more damage?
- Gender effects in hurricane names?
- Does vowel ratio correlate with intensity?

**Elections:**
- Do "authoritative" visuals win elections?
- Does symmetry predict electoral success?
- Cultural/temporal patterns in winner names?

**Ships:**
- Do "powerful" names predict battle success?
- Does prestige in name correlate with historical significance?
- Geographic vs religious names?

## 💡 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### With 72K Entities You Can:

1. **Publish academic papers**
   - Sample size is publication-grade
   - Cross-domain validation is rigorous
   - Statistical power is excellent

2. **Build prediction services**
   - Train on 70K, test on 2K
   - Real ML model possible
   - Monetizable if accurate

3. **Discover universal patterns**
   - 10 domains → strong evidence if universal
   - Or identify domain-specific patterns
   - Either way: publishable findings

4. **Test famous hypotheses**
   - Hurricane names (classic nominative determinism)
   - Political names (authority hypothesis)
   - Crypto names (tech/innovation hypothesis)

---

## 🔮 THE EXPANDED EXPERIMENT

You're now testing nominative determinism on:

- **Financial outcomes** (crypto, stocks)
- **Political outcomes** (elections)
- **Athletic performance** (NFL, MLB)
- **Entertainment success** (films, books, bands)
- **Gaming popularity** (MTG, board games)
- **Historical significance** (ships)
- **Natural phenomena** (hurricanes)

**If patterns emerge across ALL these domains:**
→ **Universal nominative determinism is real**

**If patterns are domain-specific:**
→ **Context-dependent encoding systems**

**If no patterns:**
→ **Pure art/philosophy angle**

## ✅ READY TO RUN

Configuration updated to test all 10 domains!

**Check configuration:**
```bash
cat config/auto_analysis.yaml | grep -A 20 "domains:"
```

**Run expanded analysis:**
