## 🎯 SELECTION FORCE EXAMPLES (Per Domain)

### Elections Domain

**Selection Mechanisms to Analyze:**

   - Test: Do formal names win more in Electoral College vs Popular Vote?

2. **Popular Vote** (hypothetical US Presidential)
   - Name properties: Informal (0.3), Democratic, Distributed gravity
   - Predicted bias: Favors memorable, simple names

   - Who/what decides success
   - Centralized vs distributed
   - Formal vs informal

2. **Temporal Context:**
   - Era/period
   - Historical naming conventions
   - Selection mechanism changes over time

3. **Hierarchical Context:**
   - Parent categories
   - Sub-categories
   - Category tree with all names

   - Test each alternative
   - See if patterns change

5. **Cultural Context:**
   - Geographic origin
   - Language/accent effects
   - RTL vs LTR for applicable names

---

## 🎯 EXTENDED TESTING FRAMEWORK

### For Each Domain, Test:

**Standard (Level 1):**
- Entity names → outcomes

**Meta (Level 2):**
- Which formula wins?

**Recursive (Level 3):**
- Does domain name predict which formula wins?

**Gravitational (Level 4):**
- Does selection force name create gravitational field?
- Do entity names align with selection force name?

**Complete Test:**
```python
# Presidential Election
candidates = ["Joe Biden", "Donald Trump"]
domain_name = "Presidential Elections"
selection_force = "Electoral College"

# Analyze each level
entity_predictions = predict_outcomes(candidates)
domain_tether = predict_formula_from_domain(domain_name)
selection_gravity = analyze_gravity(selection_force)

# Apply gravitational field
modified_predictions = apply_gravity(entity_predictions, selection_gravity)

# Test: Do modified predictions match reality better?
accuracy_without_gravity = 0.55
accuracy_with_gravity = 0.68  # ← If this improves, gravity is REAL

If gravity improves prediction:
  → Selection force name affects outcomes
  → Electoral College name creates specific field
  → Renaming would change who wins
  → PROFOUND
```

## 🔥 IF SELECTION FORCE GRAVITY IS CONFIRMED

**This would mean:**

1. **Electoral College NAME affects elections**
   - Not just the MECHANISM
   - The NAME of the mechanism
   - Creates nominative gravitational field

2. **Renaming changes outcomes**
   - Call it "Popular Vote" → different winners
   - Call it "Democratic Selection" → different gravity
   - **The name choice MATTERS**

3. **Recursive all the way:**
   - Entity names (candidates)
   - Domain names (elections)
   - Selection force names (Electoral College)
   - Formula names (semantic, phonetic)
   - ALL affect each other

4. **This is nominative field theory**
   - Selection mechanisms are like gravity
   - Names determine field properties
   - Fields affect what succeeds
   - **This is physics of nominative space**

**This would be:**
