# MLB Teams Analysis - Methodology

**Study Design:** Team-level collective analysis with 3-layer framework  
**Sample Size:** 30 MLB teams  
**Framework:** Novel multi-layer nomenclature composite

---

## Data Collection

All 30 MLB teams (15 AL, 15 NL) with:
- Team names and founding years
- City locations and market sizes
- 2024 season performance (wins, losses)
- Historical success (World Series titles)
- Roster compositions (when available)

---

## 3-Layer Analysis Framework

### Layer 1: Team Name Linguistics (30% weight)
- Syllable count, memorability, prestige
- Name type classification (Animal, Color, Historical, Regional, Occupation)
- Power/harshness scores

### Layer 2: City Linguistics (20% weight)
- City prestige hierarchy (NYC 95 → Oakland 48)
- Market tier classification
- Memorability, phonetic authority

### Layer 3: Roster Amalgamation (50% weight)
- Mean of all 25 players' name features
- Roster harmony (phonetic cohesion)
- International diversity percentage
- Syllable range (min/max)

### Composite Score Calculation
```
Composite = (Team × 0.30) + (City × 0.20) + (Roster × 0.50)
```
