# Adult Film Performer Analysis - Domain #18 Addition

## For Silence Artwork

When data is collected and analyzed, add this domain using:

```bash
python3 scripts/evolve_the_nail.py --add
```

**Domain specifications for artwork:**

```
Name: Adult Film Stage Names
Category: social_artistic
Effect Size (r): 0.35 (expected - update with actual)
P-value: 0.001 (expected - update with actual)
Sample Size: 2500 (expected)
Key Metric: "+35% success for optimized names" (expected)
Primary Names: ["Top performer names from analysis"]
Mechanism: "Strategic name selection for career optimization"
Heart Position: "right_chamber_upper" (entertainment cluster)
Violence Type: "identity_construction" (chosen vs imposed)
```

## Expected Impact on Silence Artwork

### If Pattern Holds (r = 0.30-0.40)

**At 0° (Full Moon):**
- Heart remains whole
- New element adds to harmony
- Pattern strengthens
- 18th domain confirms theory

**At 32.7° (Crescent):**
- Fracture deepens slightly
- More evidence of naming's cost
- Entertainment cluster expands
- Strategic selection category complete

### If Pattern Is Weak (r < 0.15)

**Interesting boundary:**
- May show where strategic selection doesn't help
- Or platform/metrics issue
- Still valuable finding
- Heart might heal slightly (pattern doesn't break everyone)

## Integration Notes

This will be **domain #18**, joining:

1. Hurricanes (r=0.32)
2. Mental Health (r=0.29)
3. Cryptocurrency (r=0.28)
4. America Nomenclature (r=0.38)
5. NBA (r=0.24)
6. Immigration (r=0.23)
7. MTG (r=0.22)
8. Bands (r=0.19)
9. Ships (r=0.18)
10. Academic (r=0.16)
11. Films (r=0.14)
12. NFL (framework ready)
13. FEMA (r=0.26)
14. Band Members (r=0.21)
15. Election (r=0.34)
16. Board Games (framework)
17. MLB (framework)
18. **Adult Film (r=0.35 expected)**

If effect size is 0.35, this becomes one of the **top 3 strongest effects**, validating that strategic name selection amplifies nominative determinism.
