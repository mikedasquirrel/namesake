## 🎯 HOW TO USE RELATIONAL ANALYSIS

### **For Each Bet, Ask:**

**NOT:** "What is this player's harshness?"

**YES:**
1. What is their harshness + nickname bonus?
2. Who is the specific opponent? (defense unit, defender, pitcher)
3. What's the career history vs this opponent?
4. What are the environmental conditions? (weather, ballpark, etc.)
5. What's the game context? (division, playoff, elimination, etc.)
6. What's the rest/travel situation?
7. What does the market think? (line displacement)
8. What's the team scheme/pace?
9. Are there ANY other contextual factors?
10. How do ALL these compound?

**Then calculate with ALL variables:**
```python
from analyzers.cross_sport_relational_framework import CrossSportRelationalFramework

analyzer = CrossSportRelationalFramework()

result = analyzer.analyze_football_relational(
    player_data=complete_player_data,
    opponent_data=specific_defense_data,
    game_context=weather_division_etc,
    market_data=lines_and_odds,
    historical_data=career_vs_team
)

# Returns: Complete relational score with all context
```
