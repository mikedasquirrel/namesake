# Study Designs & Research Frameworks

This folder contains comprehensive study design documents and cross-domain research frameworks that guide large-scale nominative determinism research across multiple domains.

## Contents

### 1. Mass-Scale Synchronicity Designs

**File:** `MASS_SCALE_SYNCHRONICITY_DESIGNS.md`

**Description:** Detailed research designs for moving from anecdotal evidence (n=12-24) to statistical proof with large sample sizes. Includes specific study protocols for testing nominative synchronicity (e.g., Dr. Chopp the urologist, Mandela the freedom fighter, HMS Beagle's Darwin connection) at scale.

**Key Features:**
- Sample size calculations and power analyses
- Data collection methodologies
- Control group designs
- Statistical validation frameworks
- Publication roadmaps

---

### 2. Cross-Domain Framework

**File:** `cross_domain_framework.md`

**Description:** Unified framework for analyzing nominative determinism patterns across different research spheres (crypto, sports, natural events, human systems). Provides standardized metrics and comparison methods.

**Key Features:**
- Universal phonetic feature extraction
- Cross-domain effect size comparisons
- Domain-specific adjustment factors
- Integration with domain_analysis_template.py
- Validation across spheres

**Applications:**
- Compare crypto names vs band names
- Identify universal vs context-specific patterns
- Meta-analysis across all domains
- Theory development and refinement

### 3. Nominative Synchronicity Meta-Analysis

**File:** `nominative_synchronicity_meta_analysis.md`

**Description:** Meta-analysis framework for systematic examination of nominative synchronicity patterns—cases where names appear to predict or align with life outcomes in remarkable ways.

**Key Features:**
- Synchronicity classification system
- Probability calculations (vs random chance)
- Aggregation methods across studies
- Publication bias assessment
- Effect size synthesis

**Examples Analyzed:**
- Professional alignment (Dr. Payne → anesthesiologist)
- Historical figures (Mandela → freedom fighter)
- Scientific discoveries (HMS Beagle → evolution theory)
- Domain-specific patterns

## Usage

### For Researchers

1. **Starting a new domain study:**
   - Use `cross_domain_framework.md` for standardized feature extraction
   - Reference `MASS_SCALE_SYNCHRONICITY_DESIGNS.md` for power analysis
   - Apply protocols from domain_analysis_template.py (in `core/`)

2. **Conducting meta-analysis:**
   - Use `nominative_synchronicity_meta_analysis.md` framework
   - Aggregate findings across domains
   - Compare effect sizes with standardized metrics

3. **Testing synchronicity cases:**
   - Follow `MASS_SCALE_SYNCHRONICITY_DESIGNS.md` protocols
   - Calculate baseline probabilities
   - Document evidence systematically

### For Developers

These frameworks integrate with:
- `core/domain_analysis_template.py` - Domain scaffolding system
