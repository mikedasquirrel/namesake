## Anticipated Key Findings

Based on patterns from 17 previous domains:

**Expected to Find:**
- **Strongest effects yet:** r = 0.30-0.40 (strategic selection amplifies)
- **Syllable effect:** -0.35 correlation (shorter = better)
- **Memorability crucial:** r = 0.35+ (visual medium advantage)
- **Stage names dominate:** +50% over real names
- **Alliteration works:** +30% premium
- **Genre predictable:** 70%+ accuracy from phonetics
- **Era evolution:** Simplifying trend confirmed
- **Platform differences:** OnlyFans distinct patterns

**Why These Predictions:**
1. Names explicitly chosen for outcomes (like popes at 100%)
2. High competition amplifies small advantages
3. Visual medium makes first impressions critical
4. Measurable metrics enable clear testing
5. Entertainment pattern should generalize
6. Strategic optimization should show in data

## Statistical Expectations

### Effect Sizes

| Hypothesis | Expected r | Comparison Domain | Expected Significance |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Syllable count | -0.35 | NBA: -0.31 | p < 0.001 |
| Memorability | 0.37 | Bands: 0.28 | p < 0.001 |
| Stage vs real | d = 1.2 | N/A | p < 0.001 |
| Genre prediction | 70% accuracy | N/A | p < 0.01 |
| Alliteration | +30% | Bands: +25% | p < 0.05 |

### Sample Power

With n = 2,500 performers:
- Can detect r = 0.06 at 80% power
- Well-powered for all expected effects (r > 0.25)
- Subgroup analyses possible (n > 200 per era)

## Integration Impact

### Platform Addition

This becomes domain #18 in the nominative determinism research platform.

**If pattern holds (r = 0.30+):**
- Strengthens overall theory significantly
- Shows strategic selection amplifies effects
- Completes "chosen names" category
- Adds to "Silence" artwork with strong data point
- May become highest correlation yet

**If pattern breaks (r < 0.15):**
- Reveals interesting boundary condition
- Tests limits of entertainment patterns
- Still valuable negative finding
- Informs theory development

**Either outcome is scientifically valuable.**

## Publication Potential

### Suitable Journals

1. **Journal of Consumer Research** - strategic branding
2. **Entertainment Studies** - industry practices
3. **Names: A Journal of Onomastics** - stage name selection
4. **Cross-domain synthesis** - Psychological Science

### Conference Presentations

- International Association for Media and Communication Research
- Popular Culture Association
- Psychonomic Society (nominative determinism session)

### Media Interest

- Likely high (accessible topic, surprising findings)
- Frames adult work as professional industry
- Educational about strategic naming
- Connects to broader platform story

2. Verify terms of service compliance
3. Run data collection script
4. Execute analysis pipeline
5. Populate this findings document
6. Integrate into platform
