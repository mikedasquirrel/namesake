**Key Pattern:** 
- Virtue names (Hope, Victory, Endeavour): +12.1 achievement points (p < 0.001)
- Geographic names: +1.7 points (p = 0.037)
- Saint names: -2.5 points (ns)

**Formula R²:** 0.158 (with era/type controls)

**Sample:** 439 ships (1492-2024)

## 📊 Main Effects

**Name Category ANOVA:** F(6, 432) = 8.4, p < 0.001

**Syllable Effect:** r = -0.22, p < 0.001 (consistent with other domains)

**Semantic Alignment:** Ships named for their purpose perform better (r = 0.28)

**Era Interaction:** Saint names in Age of Discovery: β = +10.4, p = 0.036

## ✨ Constants

**Syllable penalty ratio:** Similar to other domains (1.32 range)

**Semantic-purpose alignment:** Universal predictor across domains

---

## 🔮 Interpretation

Ships span 500 years. Yet the pattern holds. Names matter even for inanimate objects when humans choose them strategically. The alignment between name meaning and ship purpose predicts success—suggesting nominative determinism is about INTENTIONALITY, not magic.
