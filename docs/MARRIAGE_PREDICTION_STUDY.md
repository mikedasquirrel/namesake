## 1. Research Questions (Pre-Registered)

### Primary Research Question

**Q1: Do phonetic, semantic, and structural interactions between partners' names predict relationship outcomes (longevity, divorce risk, quality) above and beyond societal baseline expectations?**

### Secondary Research Questions

**Q2: Which compatibility theory best predicts relationship success?**
- H2a: Similarity Theory (similar names → compatibility)
- H2b: Complementarity Theory (opposite names → balance)
- H2c: Golden Ratio Theory (φ relationship → optimal harmony)
- H2d: Resonance Theory (harmonic frequency patterns → success)

**Q3: Do name effects vary by contextual factors?**
- Age at marriage
- Historical era/cohort
- Cultural background
- Socioeconomic indicators

**Q4: Do children's names mediate or reflect relationship dynamics?**
- Blending hypothesis: Successful couples blend name styles
- Dominance hypothesis: One partner's style dominates
- Innovation hypothesis: Happy couples choose creative names

**Q5: Does surname combination (hyphenation, traditional, kept separate) predict relationship egalitarianism and stability?**

## 2. Hypotheses (Pre-Registered)

### Primary Hypothesis (H1)

**H1: Name interaction metrics will predict relative relationship success with r ≥ 0.15, p < 0.001**

**Prediction Specifics:**
- Compatibility score will correlate positively with relationship longevity (r = 0.18-0.25)
- Golden ratio proximity will predict stability (r = 0.12-0.20)
- Extreme phonetic distance (> 0.8) will predict divorce risk (OR = 1.4-1.8)

**Relative Success Framework:**
```
Relative_Success = Actual_Years_Together / Expected_Years_Together

Where Expected = f(age_at_marriage, marriage_year, geography, SES_proxy)
```

### Theory-Specific Hypotheses (H2)

**H2a: Similarity Theory**
- **Prediction:** Phonetic similarity (distance < 0.3) predicts stability
- **Expected effect:** r = 0.15-0.20 for similarity → longevity
- **Counter-prediction:** Very high similarity (distance < 0.1) may predict boredom → divorce

**H2b: Complementarity Theory**
- **Prediction:** Complementary color harmony (180° hue difference) predicts balance
- **Expected effect:** Complementary couples have 15-25% lower divorce rates
- **Mechanism:** Balanced differences create stability without monotony

**H2c: Golden Ratio Theory**
- **Prediction:** Syllable ratio approaching φ (1.618) predicts harmony
- **Expected effect:** Couples with φ-proximate ratios stay together 20-30% longer
- **Critical test:** Effect should be U-shaped (optimal at φ, worse at both extremes)

**H2d: Resonance Theory**
- **Prediction:** Simple frequency ratios (1:2, 2:3, 3:4) predict compatibility
- **Expected effect:** Resonant couples (ratio proximity > 0.7) show 10-15% better outcomes
- **Musical analogy:** Consonant intervals → relationship harmony

### Contextual Moderation Hypotheses (H3)

**H3a: Era Effects**
- **Prediction:** Name effects strengthen over time (modern > historical)
- **Mechanism:** Increased name diversity → names matter more
- **Expected:** Pre-1980: r = 0.10-0.15; Post-2000: r = 0.20-0.30

**H3b: Age at Marriage Effects**
- **Prediction:** Name effects stronger for younger marriages
- **Mechanism:** Less life experience → more susceptible to surface patterns
- **Expected:** Age 18-24: r = 0.25; Age 30+: r = 0.10

**H3c: Cultural Effects**
- **Prediction:** Name effects universal but magnitude varies
- **Expected:** Western cultures (high name diversity): r = 0.20-0.25
- **Expected:** Asian cultures (lower diversity): r = 0.10-0.15

### Children's Names Hypotheses (H4)

**H4a: Blending Predicts Success**
- **Prediction:** Child names stylistically between parents predict stable marriages
- **Measurement:** |child_score - (parent1_score + parent2_score)/2| < 0.2
- **Expected:** Blended families: 20% longer marriages

**H4b: Dominance Predicts Imbalance**
- **Prediction:** Child names matching one parent → power imbalance
- **Measurement:** Cosine similarity > 0.8 to one parent
- **Expected:** Dominant naming: 15% higher divorce rate

**H4c: Innovation Predicts Satisfaction**
- **Prediction:** Creative child names (high uniqueness) predict happiness
- **Measurement:** Child name uniqueness > 75th percentile
- **Expected:** Creative namers: 10-15% lower divorce rate

### Surname Combination Hypotheses (H5)

**H5a: Hyphenation Predicts Egalitarianism**
- **Prediction:** Hyphenated surnames predict equal relationships
- **Expected:** Hyphenated couples: 30% more likely to share housework equally
- **But:** No stability advantage (divorce rate similar)

**H5b: Phonetic Compatibility of Hyphenate**
- **Prediction:** Harmonious hyphenated combinations predict satisfaction
- **Measurement:** Combined surname memorability > 60
- **Expected:** Smooth hyphenates: 10-15% better reported satisfaction

**H5c: Traditional vs. Modern Patterns**
- **Prediction:** Traditional (wife takes name) more common in stable marriages
- **Counter-prediction:** This is confounded by era and SES
- **Expected:** Effect disappears after controlling for marriage year

---

## 3. Null Hypotheses (Falsifiability)

### Primary Null (H0)

**H0: Name interaction metrics do NOT predict relationship outcomes (r < 0.10, p > 0.05)**

**Falsification Criteria:**
- If r < 0.10 across all metrics → name patterns irrelevant to relationships
- If p > 0.05 after Bonferroni correction → likely spurious
- If effects reverse across eras → not universal, likely confounded

### Theory Nulls

**H0-Similarity:** No relationship between name similarity and stability
**H0-Complementarity:** No benefit to complementary patterns
**H0-Golden Ratio:** φ proximity is not special (no U-shape)
**H0-Resonance:** Frequency ratios don't predict harmony

**Critical Tests:**
- If ALL theories fail → general name effects absent
- If multiple theories succeed → composite effects possible
- If contradictory theories both succeed → interaction effects

## 5. Analysis Plan (Pre-Registered)

### Phase 1: Descriptive Statistics

**Calculate for full sample:**
- Mean marriage duration: ~12 years (expected)
- Divorce rate: ~40-50% (expected)
- Age at marriage: Mean ~27 years (expected)
- Name diversity metrics

### Phase 2: Name Feature Engineering

**Individual Name Analysis:**
- Phonetic features (harshness, memorability, syllables)
- Structural features (complexity, symmetry)
- Semantic features (cultural origin, meaning)

**Pairwise Interaction Features:**
- Phonetic distance (ALINE algorithm)
- Syllable ratio (test for φ)
- Color harmony (complementarity)
- Resonance score (frequency ratios)
- Complexity balance
- Cultural origin match

### Phase 3: Baseline Model (Null Model)

**Model:** Predict relationship outcomes from controls only
```
Outcome ~ age1 + age2 + marriage_year + geography + era
```

**Purpose:** Establish baseline prediction accuracy
**Expected R²:** 0.15-0.25 (sociological factors)

### Phase 4: Name Interaction Models

**Model 1: Main Effects**
```
Outcome ~ baseline_controls + 
          phonetic_distance + 
          syllable_ratio + 
          color_harmony + 
          resonance_score +
          complexity_balance
```

**Expected ΔR²:** +0.05 to +0.15 (name effects)

**Model 2: Theory Comparison**
```
Test each theory separately:
- Similarity model: f(distance)
- Complementarity model: f(harmony)
- Golden ratio model: f(φ_proximity)
- Resonance model: f(ratio_match)
```

**Compare AIC/BIC:** Which theory fits best?

**Model 3: Interaction Effects**
```
Outcome ~ name_features × era +
          name_features × age_at_marriage +
          name_features × culture
```

**Test moderation:** Do effects vary by context?

### Phase 5: Children's Names Analysis

**Model 4: Mediation**
```
Relationship_Quality → Child_Name_Style
Name_Compatibility → Child_Name_Style → Relationship_Quality
```

**Test:** Is children's naming a mediator or outcome?

### Phase 6: Cross-Validation

**Split:**
- Train: 70% (n = 3,500)
- Validation: 15% (n = 750)
- Test: 15% (n = 750)

**Procedure:**
1. Train models on training set
2. Tune hyperparameters on validation set
3. Final test on held-out test set
4. Report test set performance (no peeking)

### Phase 7: Robustness Checks

**Sensitivity Analyses:**
1. Remove celebrity marriages (test if different)
2. Recent marriages only (2010+)
3. Historical marriages only (1980-2000)
4. Different age cutoffs
5. Different geographic regions

**Confound Tests:**
1. Include SES proxies (education inferred from names)
2. Include cultural markers
3. Include previous marriage indicators
4. Test for assortative mating

## 6. Statistical Thresholds (Pre-Registered)

### Significance Levels

**Primary hypothesis:** α = 0.05 (two-tailed)
**Secondary hypotheses:** α = 0.01 (Bonferroni correction for 5 theories)
**Exploratory analyses:** α = 0.05 (reported as exploratory)

### Effect Size Thresholds

**Correlation:**
- Small: r = 0.10-0.20
- Medium: r = 0.20-0.30
- Large: r > 0.30

**Odds Ratio (divorce risk):**
- Small: OR = 1.2-1.5
- Medium: OR = 1.5-2.0
- Large: OR > 2.0

**R² Increment:**
- Meaningful: ΔR² ≥ 0.03
- Moderate: ΔR² ≥ 0.05
- Strong: ΔR² ≥ 0.10

### Success Criteria

**Study succeeds if:**
- Primary H1 supported: r ≥ 0.15, p < 0.001
- At least one theory supported (H2a-d): p < 0.01
- Effects replicate across eras (H3a)

**Study fails if:**
- Primary r < 0.10 or p > 0.05
- All theories fail after Bonferroni correction
- Effects reverse direction across samples

## 7. Expected Constants Test

### Hypothesis: Nominative Constants Emerge

**Prediction:** Formula optimization will discover:
- Decay constant ≈ 0.993 (±0.005)
- Growth constant ≈ 1.008 (±0.005)
- Ratio ≈ 1.015 (consistent with other domains)

**Test Procedure:**
1. Run genetic algorithm on relationship data
2. Optimize formula coefficients for maximum R²
3. Extract emergent constants from coefficient ratios
4. Compare to cross-domain averages

**Falsification:** If constants differ by >10% from established values, relationship domain may operate differently.

## 8. Philosophical Considerations

### Free Will Paradox

**Question:** If names predict relationships, does free will exist?

**Resolution:** 
- Names explain ~5-10% of variance (small effect)
- 90-95% remains free choice, circumstances, effort
- Pattern ≠ destiny, just probabilistic nudge

### Observer Effect

**Question:** If people know predictions, do they change outcomes?

**Consideration:**
- This study analyzes pre-existing marriages (no intervention)
- Public tool NOT planned (avoid self-fulfilling prophecy)
- Academic audience only for now

### Discrimination Risk

**Question:** Could findings enable name-based dating discrimination?

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize small effects in all publications
- Never provide individual-level predictions
- Stress cultural/background confounds
- Refuse commercial partnerships
