## Program Structure

This research program investigates nominative effects across multiple domains using discovery science methodology. Rather than assume universal laws, we document context-specific patterns empirically and identify mechanisms through which names may influence outcomes.

### Three Integrated Programs

**Program 1: Nominative Determinism (Predictive)**  
Examines whether name features predict outcomes in specific contexts (hurricanes, collectibles, economic structures).

**Program 2: Nominative Synchronicity (Alignment)**  
Quantifies historical name-destiny alignments (HMS Beagle, revolutionary renamings) and tests whether patterns exceed chance expectations.

**Program 3: Meta-Nominative Determinism (Medical)**  
Investigates whether psychiatric disorder, therapy, and medication names influence clinical outcomes, treatment seeking, and survival.

## Principal Findings

### Hurricane Nomenclature (Program 1)

Analysis of 236 Atlantic hurricanes (1950-2023) demonstrates phonetic features predict casualty presence with cross-validated ROC AUC 0.916. Effect appears mediated through behavioral response pathways (evacuation decisions) rather than meteorological factors. Findings suggest names influence human response to threats, with potential policy applications.

### Psychiatric Nomenclature (Program 3)

Cross-sectional analysis of 50 psychiatric disorders indicates name harshness correlates with stigma (r = 0.68) and treatment-seeking rates (r = −0.52). Historical name changes (PTSD 1980, Intellectual Disability 2010) associate with substantial outcome improvements. Evidence-based naming principles proposed for DSM-6 development of technology-related disorders.

**Publication:** Manuscript prepared for The Lancet Psychiatry

### Name-Destiny Alignments (Program 2)

Systematic coding of historical cases (scientific expeditions, revolutionaries, medical careers) indicates name-outcome alignment occurs at approximately 2-fold baseline rates across domains. Analysis suggests 90% of apparent synchronicity derives from self-selection and deliberate choice rather than acausal factors, with 5-10% remaining unexplained (e.g., Nelson Mandela born "Rolihlahla," meaning troublemaker in Xhosa).

## Methodological Approach

### Discovery Orientation

We employ discovery science methodology: document observed patterns without assuming universal laws, test competing explanations, report null findings alongside positive results. This approach has identified context-specific effects (MTG card names predict instant/sorcery value but not legendary creature value) and null findings (geographic surnames do not predict landscape focus in artists).

### Cross-Validation Standard

All predictive models employ k-fold cross-validation to prevent overfitting. Primary metrics: ROC AUC for binary outcomes, cross-validated R² for continuous outcomes. This standard exceeds typical practices in nominative determinism literature.

### Causal Inference Designs

Where possible, we employ causal identification strategies: quasi-experimental designs (hurricane name assignment), within-family comparisons (sibling analyses using Add Health data), interrupted time series (historical name changes). Observational analyses explicitly acknowledge limitations and avoid causal language without appropriate design features.

## Expected Outputs

### Academic Publications (Planned)

**High priority (6-12 months):**
1. Hurricane nomenclature effects (Weather, Climate, Society)
2. Psychiatric disorder names and outcomes (The Lancet Psychiatry)
3. Within-family causal analysis of name effects on mental health (JAMA Psychiatry)
4. DSM-6 naming recommendations (APA policy document)

**Medium priority (12-24 months):**
5. HMS Beagle phenomenon and scientific expedition names (History of Science)
6. Medical name-specialty matching at scale (BMJ Christmas Issue)
7. Therapy nomenclature and clinical adoption (Clinical Psychology Review)
8. Name diversity and economic structures (Demography)

**Integration (24-36 months):**
9. Cross-domain nominative determinism framework (Psychological Science)
10. Meta-analysis of nominative synchronicity (Psychological Bulletin)

### Policy Influence

Findings may inform:
- NOAA hurricane naming guidelines
- DSM-6 diagnostic nomenclature
- Clinical training on name-based teasing and mental health
- Pharmaceutical naming practices

### Public Communication

If findings warrant: trade book synthesizing research for general audience. Working title: "Nominative Synchronicity: How Names and Destinies Align."
