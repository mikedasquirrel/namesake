# Nominative Determinism Research Program - Status Report

**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Phase:** Discovery Science - Year 1  
**Status:** Foundation building complete, execution phase beginning

---

## Executive Summary

We have established a comprehensive research program to empirically define "nominative determinism" across multiple domains. Rather than assuming names determine outcomes, we're discovering WHEN, HOW, and WHY names matter through systematic cross-domain analysis.

**Progress:** 3 domains with real data, 2 domains with complete theoretical frameworks, cross-domain synthesis complete

**Next:** Data collection (bands), causal inference (name diversity), manuscript preparation (hurricanes)

## Completed Work (Past 24 Hours)

### 1. Hurricane Deep Dive Analysis ✅
- **Script Created:** `scripts/hurricane_deep_dive_analysis.py`
- **Analyses:** Heterogeneity, mechanisms, temporal evolution, robustness, quasi-experimental

## Theoretical Contributions

### 1. Context-Activation Principle
**Definition:** Names matter when and how the context activates them

**Activation conditions:**
- Salience (name must be noticed)
- Relevance (name must relate to outcome)
- Mechanism (pathway must exist)
- Absence of confounds (signal not overwhelmed)

**Evidence:** Hurricanes (high activation) vs MTG legendaries (low activation)

### 2. Nominative Determinism Redefined

**Old definition:** Names determine outcomes  
**New definition:** Measurable correlation between name features and outcomes, mediated by context-specific mechanisms, with effect sizes/directions varying by domain

**Better term:** "Context-Activated Naming Effects" or "Nominative Influence"

### 3. Mechanisms Taxonomy

**Five pathways identified:**
1. Behavioral Response (hurricanes: threat perception → evacuation)
2. Market Signaling (MTG: aesthetic signal → collectible value)
3. Cultural Capital (diversity: individualism → economic structure)
4. Identity Expression (bands predicted: pronunciation → ideology signal)
5. Network Effects (lineage predicted: success → imitation → propagation)

### 4. Cross-Domain Patterns

**Pattern 1:** No universal formula (context determines what matters)  
**Pattern 2:** Mechanism matters more than effect size  
**Pattern 3:** Confounds are domain-specific  
**Pattern 4:** Non-linear relationships common (inverse-U, cycles)  
**Pattern 5:** Cultural associations dominate pure phonetics

## Risk Assessment

### High Confidence (Low Risk)

- ✅ Hurricane paper will publish (strong signal, clear findings)
- ✅ MTG paper publishable (novel domain, clean patterns)
- ✅ Name diversity descriptive findings solid (large sample)

### Medium Confidence (Moderate Risk)

- ⚠️ Name diversity causal claims (need better data, natural experiments)
- ⚠️ Band collection feasibility (API rate limits, data quality)
- ⚠️ Framework paper acceptance (high bar for top journals)

### Low Confidence (High Risk, High Reward)

- ❓ CHY-NAH validation (could be null or weaker than predicted)
- ❓ Geopolitical linguistics general (paradigm-shifting if true, speculative if not)
- ❓ Phonetic lineage (network effects hard to establish causally)

### Contingency Plans

**If band collection fails:**
- Focus on 3-domain framework (hurricanes, MTG, diversity)
- Still publishable, less comprehensive

**If CHY-NAH doesn't validate:**
- Pivot to colonial legacy findings (more conservative)
- Still novel, less shocking

**If publications rejected:**
- Lower-tier journals for incremental findings
- Preprint servers for visibility
- Iterate based on feedback
