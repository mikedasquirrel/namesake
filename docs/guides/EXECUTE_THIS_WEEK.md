# Execute This Week - Immediate Action Plan

**Goal:** Get 2 papers submitted by end of month  
**Timeline:** 7 days  
**Budget:** $0  
**Difficulty:** Low (infrastructure ready)

---

## 📅 DAY-BY-DAY PLAN

### MONDAY (Day 1) - 4 hours

**Morning: Test Mass-Scale Scripts**

```bash
cd /Users/michaelsmerconish/Desktop/RandomCode/FlaskProject

# Test 1: Medical names (30 min)
python3 scripts/collect_medical_names_mass_scale.py

# Test 2: Baby names methodology (30 min)
python3 scripts/baby_names_within_family_causal.py

# Test 3: Scientists pilot (30 min)
python3 scripts/collect_scientists_mass_scale.py
```

**Afternoon: Review Results**
- Did NPI API work?
- Is methodology clear?
- Is mass-scale feasible?

**Decision point:** If feasible → commit to full medical names collection for BMJ

---

### TUESDAY (Day 2) - 6 hours

**Full Day: Medical Names Collection (If API Worked)**

```bash
# Run full collection
# Target: 10,000-40,000 physicians tested
python3 scripts/collect_medical_names_mass_scale.py --full-scale

# This will:
# 1. Search for Hart, Blood, Brain, Bone, Payne surnames
# 2. Check their specialties
# 3. Test: Observed vs Expected rates
# 4. Output: Statistical results
```

**Expected output:**
- Hart → Cardiology: 1.8-2.2x baseline (predicted)
- Blood → Hematology: 3.0-4.0x baseline
- Overall: 18% match vs 10% baseline

**If results strong:** You have BMJ Christmas Issue paper ready!

## 📈 EXPECTED WEEK 1 OUTCOMES

### Medical Names Test Results (Predicted)

```
MEDICAL NAMES MASS-SCALE RESULTS

Testing: Hart → Cardiology
  Found: 2,847 physicians named Hart
  In cardiology: 412 (14.5%)
  Expected: 228 (8.0%)
  Odds Ratio: 1.95x
  p-value: <0.001 ✓ SIGNIFICANT

Testing: Blood → Hematology
  Found: 186 physicians named Blood
  In hematology: 12 (6.5%)
  Expected: 0.9 (0.5%)
